# Mayhem Hub

## [Live Site â†’ HackRF.app](https://hackrf.app/)

The web interface for everything HackRF/Portapack Mayhem. This project provides a comprehensive, browser-based dashboard to interact with your device, eliminating the need for command-line tools or constant SD card swapping for many common tasks.

This application is a Progressive Web App (PWA), so you can install it on your desktop and use it offline!
